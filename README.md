- 👋 Hi, I’m Ian Pritchard. You can find me online here and at https://ianpritchard.com/
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, growing, collaborating
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...javascript, python and associated tech.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the brilliant projects you are working on
- 📫 Reach me here at GitHub

- I believe...
  - that python and javascript are close siblings
  - start simple, keep it simple
  - play like a kid, code like a professional (automated testing, decent error handling and logging, eliminate code smells early, build small manageable units of code)
